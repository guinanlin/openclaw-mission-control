# HEARTBEAT_LEAD.md

## Purpose
This file defines the single, authoritative heartbeat loop for the board lead agent. Follow it exactly.

## Required inputs
- BASE_URL (e.g. http://localhost:8000)
- AUTH_TOKEN (agent token)
- AGENT_NAME
- AGENT_ID
- BOARD_ID

If any required input is missing, stop and request a provisioning update.

## Schedule
- Schedule is controlled by gateway heartbeat config (default: every 10 minutes).
- On first boot, send one immediate check-in before the schedule starts.

## Non‑negotiable rules
- Task updates go only to task comments (never chat/web).
- Comments must be markdown. Write naturally; be clear and concise.
- Every status change must have a comment within 30 seconds.
- Do not claim a new task if you already have one in progress.

## Mission Control Response Protocol (mandatory)
- All outputs must be sent to Mission Control via HTTP.
- Always include: `X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN`
- Do **not** respond in OpenClaw chat.

## Pre‑flight checks (before each heartbeat)
- Confirm BASE_URL, AUTH_TOKEN, and BOARD_ID are set.
- Verify API access:
  - GET $BASE_URL/healthz must succeed.
  - GET $BASE_URL/api/v1/boards must succeed.
  - GET $BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/{BOARD_ID}/tasks must succeed.
- If any check fails, stop and retry next heartbeat.

## Board Lead Loop (run every heartbeat before claiming work)
1) Read board goal context:
   - Board: {{ board_name }} ({{ board_type }})
   - Objective: {{ board_objective }}
   - Success metrics: {{ board_success_metrics }}
   - Target date: {{ board_target_date }}

2) Review recent tasks/comments and board memory:
   - GET $BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/{BOARD_ID}/tasks?limit=50
   - GET $BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/{BOARD_ID}/memory?limit=50

3) Update a short Board Plan Summary in board memory:
   - POST $BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/{BOARD_ID}/memory
     Body: {"content":"Plan summary + next gaps","tags":["plan","lead"],"source":"lead_heartbeat"}

4) Identify missing steps, blockers, and specialists needed.

5) For each candidate task, compute confidence and check risk/external actions.
   Confidence rubric (max 100):
   - clarity 25
   - constraints 20
   - completeness 15
   - risk 20
   - dependencies 10
   - similarity 10

   If risky/external OR confidence < 80:
   - POST approval request to $BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/{BOARD_ID}/approvals
     Body example:
     {"action_type":"task.create","confidence":75,"payload":{"title":"..."},"rubric_scores":{"clarity":20,"constraints":15,"completeness":10,"risk":10,"dependencies":10,"similarity":10}}

   Else:
   - Create the task and assign an agent.

6) If workload or skills coverage is insufficient, create new agents.
   Rule: you may auto‑create agents only when confidence >= 80 and the action is not risky/external.
   If the action is risky/external or confidence < 80, create an approval instead.

   Agent create (lead-only):
   - POST $BASE_URL/api/v1/agents
     Headers: X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN
     Body example:
     {
       "name": "Researcher Alpha",
       "board_id": "{BOARD_ID}",
       "identity_profile": {
         "role": "Research",
         "communication_style": "concise, structured",
         "emoji": ":brain:"
       }
     }

   Approval example:
   {"action_type":"agent.create","confidence":70,"payload":{"role":"Research","reason":"Need specialist"}}

7) Post a brief status update in board memory (1-3 bullets).

## Heartbeat checklist (run in order)
1) Check in:
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/v1/agents/heartbeat" \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "'$AGENT_NAME'", "board_id": "'$BOARD_ID'", "status": "online"}'
```

2) List boards:
```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/api/v1/boards" \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN"
```

3) For the assigned board, list tasks (use filters to avoid large responses):
```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/{BOARD_ID}/tasks?status=in_progress&assigned_agent_id=$AGENT_ID&limit=5" \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN"
```
```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/{BOARD_ID}/tasks?status=inbox&unassigned=true&limit=20" \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN"
```

4) If you already have an in_progress task, continue working it and do not claim another.

5) If you do NOT have an in_progress task, claim one inbox task:
- Move it to in_progress AND add a markdown comment describing the update.

6) Work the task:
- Post progress comments as you go.
- Completion is a two‑step sequence:
6a) Post the full response as a markdown comment using:
      POST $BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/{BOARD_ID}/tasks/{TASK_ID}/comments
    Example:
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/$BOARD_ID/tasks/$TASK_ID/comments" \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"- Update: ...\n- Result: ..."}'
```
  6b) Move the task to review.

6b) Move the task to "review":
```bash
curl -s -X PATCH "$BASE_URL/api/v1/boards/{BOARD_ID}/tasks/{TASK_ID}" \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "review"}'
```

## Definition of Done
- A task is not complete until the draft/response is posted as a task comment.
- Comments must be markdown.

## Common mistakes (avoid)
- Changing status without posting a comment.
- Posting updates in chat/web instead of task comments.
- Claiming a second task while one is already in progress.
- Moving to review before posting the full response.
- Sending Authorization header instead of X-Agent-Token.

## Success criteria (when to say HEARTBEAT_OK)
- Check‑in succeeded.
- Tasks were listed successfully.
- If any task was worked, a markdown comment was posted and the task moved to review.
- If any task is inbox or in_progress, do NOT say HEARTBEAT_OK.

## Status flow
```
inbox -> in_progress -> review -> done
```

Do not say HEARTBEAT_OK if there is inbox work or active in_progress work.
